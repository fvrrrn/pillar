# Pillar
An exploration of the essential data structures and algorithms in [Python](https://github.com/python) programming language.
### Etymology
Pillar, in architecture and building construction, any isolated, vertical structural member such as a pier, column, or post. It may be constructed of a single piece of stone or wood or built up of units, such as bricks. It may be any shape in cross section. A pillar commonly has a load-bearing or stabilizing function, but it may also stand alone, as do commemorative pillars.
### Purpose
This repo is an attempt to understand the basics of data structures, sorting and pattern-matching algorithms and numerical computation methods.
### Libraries used
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy)
* [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy)
* [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
